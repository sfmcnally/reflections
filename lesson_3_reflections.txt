These are my reflections for lesson 3. We are learning to push and pull from github so that we can work on projects with others.

I would use a remote repository any time I wanted to work with someone who was in another location or even if I wanted to work on something from several locations myself


You want to pull manually so that you can merge your changes with the code that you think you are working with instead of something that is changing under you.


Forking allows you to edit code on github that is in a repository that you don't have permission to edit. Then you can push and pull that code from your own version.

you always want to fetch a copy of the remote code so that you can see it and merge with it even if you are working offline.
