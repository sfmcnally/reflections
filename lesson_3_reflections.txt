These are my reflections for lesson 3. We are learning to push and pull from github so that we can work on projects with others.

I would use a remote repository any time I wanted to work with someone who was in another location or even if I wanted to work on something from several locations myself


You want to pull manually so that you can merge your changes with the code that you think you are working with instead of something that is changing under you.
